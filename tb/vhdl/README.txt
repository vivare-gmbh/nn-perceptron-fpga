This test bench "tb_avm_instruction_gen_v04_public.vhd" is only for your information.
First, its doing some tests (e.g. from early stage of development) and implement a
transaction environment to document each stage of testing while simulation.

Its do a setup, training and testing of the sample application (look at
the core's specification /doc/specification_NN_Perceptron_v01_20220720
"Appendix B - Sample Application" for detailed information) too.

Files are written to the file system while simulation too (work folder) as described
in Appendix B.

Take a closer look at these files and find out more by yourself.
More information about scoreboards, simulation, verification and requirement
tracing of this core are NOT public.
